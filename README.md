Minimum Spanning tree algorithms on graphs (Kruskal and reverse-delete algorithms)


Here you can find my implementation of kruskal and reverse-delete algorithm on a graph.
Feel free to take what you need, it's here for everyone! 
(This is the progect I made for LPP exam. Bachelor's degree in informatics at Turin university)

The graph.txt file is just an example of the txt format this program takes in input. You can make any file you want...
Just run the program and it will ask you which file you want to use as graph file.
